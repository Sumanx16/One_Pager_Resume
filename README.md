## Design & UX Philosophy

The design of this one-pager was intentionally chosen to be more engaging and persuasive than a static document.

1.  **"Strategic Fit" View**: Instead of a long block of text, my argument is broken into three distinct "pillars." This allows a user, like a hiring manager, to explore the evidence for each claim at their own pace, improving comprehension. This is supported quantitatively by the skills radar chart.
2.  **"Crisis Plan" View**: A 5-step list was translated into a horizontal, interactive process flow. This is a superior user experience because it visually represents the **procedural nature** of the plan. Clicking each step reveals its details, preventing the user from being overwhelmed by a wall of text.

The overall goal is to prioritize clarity, user engagement, and a direct alignment with the core arguments being presented.
